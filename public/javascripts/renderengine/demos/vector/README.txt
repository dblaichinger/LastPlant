The vector demo is intended to show the vector drawing capabilities of The Render Engine.  It is a simple implementation of Asteroids (originally copyrighted by Atari, Corp. in 1979).  It demonstrates the following:

* Vector drawing with the vector component
* Motion with the 2D movement component
* Reading the query string for optional configurations
* The vector text renderer
* Keyboard input
* The particle engine & custom particle types
* The spatial grid collision model
* Box to box collision detection
